Notebooks used for testing and development
- `AE.ipynb`: Training autoencoder on Raman data. Just a test to see if it works :)
- `KL_Divergence.ipynb`: Exploration of KL divergence
- `PCA.ipynb`: Exploration of PCA on Raman data including the plotting of the PCA results
- `MSE_fit`: Exploration of MSE fit on Raman data including timing experiment and plotting
- `plot_autoencoder_exp.ipynb`: Plotting the results of the autoencoder experiment and calculating MSE and timing results
- `plot_vae_exp.ipynb`: Plotting the results of the VAE experiment and calculating MSE and timing results
- `plot_vae_voigt_exp.ipynb`: Plotting the results of the VAE with Voigt decoder experiment and calculating MSE and timing results
- `plot_vae_voigt_cnn_exp.ipynb`: Plotting the results of the VAE with Voigt decoder and CNN experiment and calculating MSE and timing results
- `paths.py`: Defining paths to data, results, etc. Imported in the other notebookst to be able to access the other directories
- `plot_data.ipynb`: Plotting the data
